  <b>Imagine you're waiting for a webpage to load.</b> You've probably seen
  those little spinning circles or bars that appear while you wait. That's what
  the Loader Component is! It's the part of the website that shows you something
  is happening behind the scenes while you wait for the page to finish loading.
  It can look different depending on what the website is doing, but its job is
  always the same: to let you know that the website is working on something and
  to keep you from getting frustrated while you wait.
