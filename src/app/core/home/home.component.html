    <h2 class="section-title">Understanding Core Angular Constructs</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
      <h3 class="subsection-title">Components:</h3>
      <p class="subsection-description">
        The visual building blocks of Angular applications. Each component
        encapsulates a portion of the user interface (UI) and its associated
        logic. Composed of two primary parts:
      </p>
      <ul class="subsection-list">
        <li>Template: Defines the HTML structure of the component's view.</li>
        <li>
          Class: Contains the component's TypeScript logic, handling data,
          events, and interactions with other parts of the application.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsection-description">
        Components are hierarchical, creating a tree-like structure that
        reflects the UI's composition.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subsection-title">Key concepts:</h3>
      <ul class="subsection-list">
        <li>
          Selectors: Used to identify and insert components into other
          components' templates.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inputs and Outputs: Mechanisms for data communication between parent
          and child components.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lifecycle hooks: Methods invoked at specific stages of a component's
          lifecycle (e.g., creation, update, destruction).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="subsection-title">Pipes:</h3>
      <p class="subsection-description">
        Transform data before displaying it in the template. Pure and impure
        pipes are available:
      </p>
      <ul class="subsection-list">
        <li>
          Pure pipes are deterministic and cache results, recalculating only
          when input values change.
        </li>
        <li>
          Impure pipes are not cached and re-execute on every change detection
          cycle.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsection-description">
        Built-in pipes: uppercase, lowercase, date, currency, number, and more.
        Custom pipes can be created to perform specific data transformations.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subsection-title">Services:</h3>
      <p class="subsection-description">
        Reusable logic containers shared across components. Ideal for handling
        data fetching, API interactions, state management, and other shared
        functionalities. Injected into components using dependency injection.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subsection-title">Directives:</h3>
      <p class="subsection-description">
        Modify the appearance or behavior of DOM elements. Two types:
      </p>
      <ul class="subsection-list">
        <li>Component directives: Create new custom elements.</li>
        <li>Attribute directives: Change the behavior of existing elements.</li>
        <li>
          Structural directives: Modify the DOM structure by adding, removing,
          or manipulating elements.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="subsection-description">
        Built-in directives: ngIf, ngFor, ngStyle, ngClass, and more. Custom
        directives can be created to implement custom behaviors.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subsection-title">API Integration for Dynamic Applications</h3>
      <p class="subsection-description">
        Angular applications often require real-world data to deliver a rich
        user experience. API integration connects the application to external
        data sources. The HttpClient module is Angular's primary tool for making
        HTTP requests.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subsection-title">Best practices:</h3>
      <ul class="subsection-list">
        <li>Design clear API contracts.</li>
        <li>Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms.</li>
        <li>Optimize performance through caching and lazy loading.</li>
        <li>Secure API communication.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="subsection-title">
        Combining Core Constructs and API Integration
      </h3>
      <p class="subsection-description">
        By effectively utilizing components, pipes, services, and directives,
        along with seamless API integration, developers can create robust and
        scalable Angular applications.
      </p>
      <p class="subsection-description">
        Components structure the UI, displaying data fetched from APIs using
        pipes. Services handle API interactions, providing data to components.
        Directives enhance the UI's behavior and appearance based on data and
        user interactions.
      </p>
      <p class="subsection-description">
        Together, these elements create a cohesive and dynamic user experience.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subsection-title">Application Versatility</h3>
      <p class="subsection-description">
